## Asteroids

You can play the game at: https://ggiraldo.github.io/

This is an asteroids game developed in HTML5 and Javascript, mainly with the help
of the https://p5js.org/ library.

Inspired by the Coding Challenge videos from Daniel Shiffman, but built from scratch
and with some creative freedoms taken:

## About the game

The game is a version of the classic asteroids game made to run in the browser.
Also, as stated by Daniel Shiffman, the next step is to implement an AI capable
of playing the game. As such, this version is intended to provide the easiest way
of implementing the playing automation.
